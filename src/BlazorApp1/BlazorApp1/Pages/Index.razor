 <h3>Development Mode</h3>
            <p>
                Swapping to the <strong>Development</strong> environment displays detailed information about the error that occurred.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>The Development environment shouldn't be enabled for deployed applications.</strong>
                It can result in displaying sensitive information from exceptions to end users.
                For local debugging, enable the <strong>Development</strong> environment by setting the <strong>ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT</strong> environment variable to <strong>Development</strong>
                and restarting the app.
